# IIsc-web
I used tensor flow in the backend- COCO-SSD model to perform the object detection of the images, i have used multiclass detection which detects multiple objects in the given image, it also shows the accuracy percentage of the predicted object.
All the dependencies, libraries have been used in the code, you just have to run the code.
